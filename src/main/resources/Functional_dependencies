Functional Dependencies

1)actor(username->password,role_name)
username is a primary key. Hence this is in BCNF

2)activity_category(id->activity_name)
id is a primary key. Hence this is in BCNF

3)re_rule
re_rule_code,version -> activity_category_code,nums_points,version,status,lp_code
re_rule_code -> activity_category_code, lp_code
Here, re_rule_code,version is the primary key. There is partial dependency of activity_category_code and lp_code
on re_rule_code. Hence this table is in 2NF.

4)rr_rule
rr_rule_code,version->reward,num_points,version,status,lp_code
rr_rule_code -> reward, lp_code
Here, rr_rule_code,version is the primary key. There is partial dependency of reward and lp_code
on rr_rule_code. Hence this table is in 2NF.

5)brand(id->name,address,join_date,user_name)

6)loyalty_program
id->program_name,brand_id,tier_type,state
brand_id->program_name, id, tier_type, state
Here id is primary key and brand_id is candidate key. Hence this table is in BCNF

7)activities_for_loyalty_program
activity_lp_map_id->loyalty_program_code,activity_category_code
loyalty_program_code,activity_category_code -> activity_lp_map_id
Here activity_lp_map_id is primary key and loyalty_program_code,activity_category_code is candidate key.
Hence this table is in BCNF


8)customer(id->name,phone,address,user_name)
id is primary key. This table is in BCNF

9)tier(id-> name, points, multiplier, lp_program_id)
id is primary key. This table is in BCNF

10)customer_redeem_activity(id -> customer_id,activity_date,redeem_lp_map_id,points)
id is primary key. This table is in BCNF

11)customer_activity(id -> customer_id,activity_date,activity_lp_map_id, customer_redeem_activity_id,points)
id is primary key. This table is in BCNF

12)reward_category(id -> reward_name)
id is primary key. This table is in BCNF

13)wallet(id -> points,customer_id,loyalty_program_code)
id is primary key. This table is in BCNF

14)customer_lp_enroll(customer_id,loyalty_program_code -> customer_id,loyalty_program_code)
customer_id,loyalty_program_code is primary key. This table is in BCNF

15)rewards_for_loyalty_program
reward_lp_map_id->loyalty_program_code,reward_category_code,reward_count,reward_value
loyalty_program_code,reward_category_code->reward_lp_map_id, reward_count,reward_value

Here reward_lp_map_id is primary key and loyalty_program_code,reward_category_code is candidate key.
Hence this table is in BCNF
